                        to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password. Objective: : In this method, the user is required to select some images (let’s say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk
                        is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially.
                        Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it. We need techniques
                        that can be easily implemented and provide better results to this process.</td>
